# So you've decided to make static graphics.
* Use the .AI template. This is the 16x9 graphic.
* Be mindful of the inner margin if making a gallery.
* Duplicating the artboard in a single AI file makes it easier to output (and reoutput) graphics. Especially galleries or items with repeated elements such as headers.
* Output as **full-res JPEGs**. P2P will do all the web-friendly processing.
* Keep them simple and free of most decorations and text. Two charts max.
* These should be made with an eye toward embedding. As little text as possible. Text trapped in images is bad, so let's keep it to a minimum
* As long as you stick to the template, mobile design isn't a big deal. The template is made for this.
