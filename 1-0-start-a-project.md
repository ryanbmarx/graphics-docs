#How to start a project
## Get assignment, collect information, brainstorm until you have an idea
## Decide what format it should be
* **Digital first:** This should be thought through before the print graphic. 
* Your primary options
  - **Static:** Reserved for simple charts (1-2 per image). When a chart has little value standing alone, an embeddable static graphic is a good choice.
  - **Graphics gallery:** This can be very effective in situations where the charting is copious but not complex. Like static graphics, galleries are embeddable within stories. Polls are very successful in this format.
  - **HTML story:** If the idea is text-heavy, more complex than a simple chart and/or has interactive opportunities choose an HTML story.
  - **Tarbell app:** With greater capabilities within NGUX, tarbell projects have a very high bar. THe project should require tons of custom elemtns and/or have a long shelf life. All Tarbell apps also require P2P story link assets and a URL redirect.
* The skedmaker will make a best guess at a format on the daily graphics sked, but it's usually only a guess. Gather some data. Learn something. If you think an alternate format is better, then say so. Make sure there isn't a bigger plan.

## Editing
* Reporter must see the content.
* Late editor must see the content. At this stage, it's a pretty good idea to make sure Ryan sees it, too, even if he isn't the editor.
* If printing, previewing and/or emailed PDFs are not viable distribution options, then check "no index, no follow" and make it live. This should be a temporary solution (mere hours). ![Scereenshot of a P2P edit screen](http://photodesk.chicagotribune.com.s3.amazonaws.com/graphics-toolbox/documentation/no-index-no-follow.png)


## Fill out p2p fields
* Use your name, if you like, but include your own Twitter handle. _Have you set your P2P defaults?_
* **Slug** should be SEO

* **Headline** should be sexy, and SEO if possible.

* **SEO headline**, **SEO description** should be boring and front-loaded with search terms.

* **SEO keywords:** Up to ten, seperated by commas. One of them should be "onlinegraphic"

* **Thumbnail. Thumbnail. Thumbnail:** Should be representative of the graphic, but not necessarily a screengrab. p2p does soft crops on them, so any objecitonable material should be cropped in photoshop.

* Should be **related/embedded** to main story if at all possible.

## Wrapping up:
* Email to skedmaker: 
  - Slug
  - Status (Live, working but ready, working awaiting edits, needs relating, etc.)
  - Copy desk status (which editor has it?)
  - Any embargoes. These are your responsilibity.
  - A suggested tweet/shareline.
* Communicate with both Jonathon/Ryan and the *zzctc-ctweb* and *Ct-digital-editors* when assets are ready and if they will need to be flipped live.
* Tweet it: Put it out there, then we can grab it and reshare.
