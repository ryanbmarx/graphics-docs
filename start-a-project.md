#How to start a project
##1. Get assignment, collect information
##2. Decide what format it should be
	* Options: 
		+ Static: Reserved for simple charts (1-2 per image). Let's not forget galleries
		+ HTML story: Better for items with lots of type or interactive needs
		+ Tarbell app: Very high bar. Should have tons of custom needs and/or a long shelf life. Requires P2P story link asset.
	* Discuss: The skedmaker will make a best guess, but that's all it is. Gather some data. Learn something. If you think an alternate format is needed, that says so.
	* Digital first: This should be thought through before the print graphic. 

##3. So you've decided to make static graphics.
	* Use the .AI template. This is the 16x9 graphic.
	* Be mindful of the inner margin if making a gallery.
	* Duplicating the artboard in a single AI file makes it easier to output (and reoutput) graphics.
	* Output as full-res JPEGs. P2P will do all the web-friendly processing.
	* Keep them simple and free of most decorations and text. Two charts max.
	* These should be made with an eye toward embedding.
	* As long as you stick to the template, mobile design isn't a big deal. The template is made for this.

##4. HTML stories
	* If it doesn't work on mobile, then it doesn't work.
	* Sketch this out, even in really basic ways.
	* Lots of text... text on images is bad.
	* diagrams: Numbers/Letters and lists
	* Sketch the desktop version, too (see what i did there?)
	* Use a proper text editor
	* Download the startup doc
		+ It's a ZIP on S3.
		+ It's got a new css file.
		+ Always start with it, so upgrades/changes can be made.
		+ Practice semantic coding: codeacademy.org
			- Tables != design tools. Use the zebra figure.
			- New legend format
		+ Get it workin pretty good off your desktop, then put it in p2p. There will invariably be tweaks needed, though the template tries to minimize that. The more you communicate about issues you have the better the template will become.
	* Not every crayon ... we have a clicker, but is that needed. What about sortable/searhable tables? 

##5. So you've decided on a tarbell app. 
	* There are no guidelines. This is a pure custom job and you should work with Ryan on it.

##6. Editing
	* Reporter must see the content.
	* Late editor must see the content. At this stage, pretty good idea to make sure Ryan sees it, too.
	* If printing out, previewing and/or emailed PDFs are not options, then check "no index, no follow" and make it live. This should be a temporary solution (mere hours).


##7. Fill out p2p fields
	* Use your name, if you like
	* slug should be SEO
	* Headline should be sexy, and SEO if possible.
	* SEO headline, SEO description should be boring and front-loaded with search terms. 
	* SEO keywords: Up to ten, seperated by commas. One of them should be "onlinegraphic"
	* Thumbnail. Thumbnail. Thumbnail: Should be representative of the graphic, but not necessarily a screengrab. p2p does soft crops on them, so any objecitonable material should be cropped in photoshop.
	* Should be related/embedded to main story if at all possible.

##8. Wrapping up:
	* Email to skedmaker: 
		+ slug
		+ status (Live, working but ready, working awaiting edits, needs relating, etc.)
		+ Copy desk status (which editor has it?)
		+ Any embargoes. These are your responsilibity.
		+ A suggested tweet/shareline.
	* Tweet it: Put it out there, then we can grab it and reshare.
